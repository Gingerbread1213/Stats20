## Question 1

### (a)
“**Sometimes you have to make the hardest climb to see the most beautiful sunrise.** I read that once on an old lady’s decorative pillow, but it is really how I feel today. I’ve climbed a very weird and rocky mountain, and it was a pain in the ass, and my legs are tired, and I’m starving. But *the sun is rising over a sea of love and waffles and possibility.* So *I’m just gonna relax and take a deep breath and enjoy this view for as long as I possibly can.”* – Leslie Knope (from ***Parks and Recreation***)

## Question 2

### (a)
The video inspires the audience about how computer will act like if gives bad instruction. The program need to be as clear as possible, and lead the computer to the right direction. 

### (b)
First, we need to get a piece of 1/3 pound ground beef, a piece of cheese and two piece of bread.
Second, we need to put the ground beef onto the grill pan and cook for 90 seconds then flip it to the other side and cook for another 90 seconds. Take it out after.
Then, we have to put the two pieces of bread onto the grill pan and cook for 30 seconds. Take it out after.
Lastly, take a piece of bread and put it on table, then place the grilled beef from step 2 and lay it on top of the bread which I placed on the table. Place one cheese piece on top of it and then place the grilled bread on top of the cheese with the grilled side face down.

  monthly_dep <- (cap_cost-res_val)/n
  monthly_fine_char <- (cap_cost+res_val)*mf

## Question 7

### (a)
<!-- ENTER YOUR ANSWER BELOW -->
The minimum number of coins required to equal 47 cents is $0.25+0.1*2+0.01*2$, 5 coins in total. To get this number, I first divide the total by the largest coin and keep the reminder, then use the reminder to divide the following large coin, and so on.


### (b)
<!-- ENTER YOUR ANSWER BELOW -->
To get the number above, I first divide the total by the largest coin and keep the reminder, then use the reminder to divide the following large coin, and so on.

### (c)
<!-- CREATE THE FUNCTION IN THE CODE CHUNK BELOW -->
<!-- NAME THE FUNCTION AND ITS INPUTS EXACTLY AS STATED IN THE ASSIGNENT -->
```{r Question 7c}
get_minimum_coins<- function(n){
  n<-n*100
  count <- 0
  count <- count+(n%/%25)

  n <- n%%25
  count <- count+(n%/%10)

  n <- n%%10
  count <- count+(n%/%5)
  
  n <- n%%5
  count <- count+(n%/%1)
  count
}
```

### (d)
<!-- USE THE CODE CHUNK BELOW -->

get_minimum_coins(0.31)
get_minimum_coins(0.48)
get_minimum_coins(1.39)

```

(i) <!-- ENTER YOUR ANSWER TO THE RIGHT OF THIS OR BELOW -->3

(ii) <!-- ENTER YOUR ANSWER TO THE RIGHT OF THIS OR BELOW -->6

(iii) <!-- ENTER YOUR ANSWER TO THE RIGHT OF THIS OR BELOW -->10

### (e)
<!-- USE THE CODE CHUNK BELOW -->
```{r Question 7e}
get_minimum_coins(0.99)
```
<!-- ENTER YOUR EXPLANATION BELOW -->My logic of finding the number of cents that requires the most coins is to maximize all type of coin. Where the amount of money can't by substitute by a larger coin. $4*0.01+0.05+0.1*4+0.25*2=0.99$. And this requires 9 coins

## Question 8
<!-- THIS IS THE CODE GIVEN IN THE ASSIGNMENT -->
```{r Question 8 Background, echo = TRUE}
x <- 3
y <- 4
exp1 <- function() {
  x^y
}
exp2 <- function(x = 2) {
  x^y
}
exp_y <- function(x) {
  function(y) {
    x^y
  }
}
```

### (a)
<!-- ENTER YOUR ANSWER BELOW -->When printing out exp1(), there is no default value set in the function, therefore, it will use the number that already given to x and y. However, in exp2(), there is a default value that is already given to x. Therefore, when we running this function, x will be determined as 2 instead of 3.

### (b)
<!-- ENTER YOUR ANSWER BELOW -->
When running exp_y, it will print out word that is written in the function. I will not throw an error, because r will give out the address of the function. However, it will never gives any numeric output.
### (c)
<!-- USE THE CODE CHUNK BELOW -->
```{r Question 8c}
exp_y <- function() {
  15^y
}


exp_y()
```
